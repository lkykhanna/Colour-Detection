# Colour-Detection
Project in Python – Colour Detection using Pandas &amp; OpenCV


## The Dataset
Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. So in how many ways we can define a color? The answer is 256*256*256 = 16,581,375. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. In our dataset, we need to map each color’s values with their corresponding names. But don’t worry, we don’t need to map all the values. We will be using a dataset that contains RGB values with their corresponding names.

## The project folder contains 3 files:

Color_detection.py – main source code of our project.
Colorpic.jpg – sample image for experimenting.
Colors.csv – a file that contains our dataset.
